This is where you will place images, hopefully. These are some stuff to follow so we don't get in trouble and have a good looking website :)

- If possible get .png or transparent images (To give the website a good look)
- Be sure the images have "Public Domain", "All Creative Commons", or "Free to Share and Use Commercially" licenses. (I don't want to be arrested)
- Make sure that the images have good names before adding them into the Assets folder. (To make our code look good and readable)
- Make sure that the image is <25MB (It will count as a large object in GitHub, and will cost real moneys)

That's mostly it, and thanks!

Guide to starting the Local Website:

- Make sure you have Node JS installed on your pc: https://nodejs.org/en
Add Node.js and npm to your PATH:

-On Windows:
        
- After installing Node.js, make sure to select the option to "Automatically install the necessary tools..." during installation. This will add Node.js and npm to your PATH.
        
- If you skipped this during installation or are still having issues, you can manually add Node.js and npm to your PATH:
            
            
 - Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar and click on "Edit the system environment variables."
           
           
 - In the "System Properties" window, click the "Environment Variables" button.
            
- In the "System Variables" section, find the "Path" variable, select it, and click "Edit."
            
- Click "New" and add the path to your Node.js and npm installation. The default installation path is typically C:\Program Files\nodejs\.

- 1: Clone repository Open in VScode
- 2: Open terminal in VScode (control j)
- 3: Run command: npm install 4. Run command: npm run dev

This should then give you the link to the local host website. It is very generic at this point but the backbone is in and it is ready to be worked on.
