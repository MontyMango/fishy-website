- Make sure you have Node JS installed on your pc: https://nodejs.org/en
Add Node.js and npm to your PATH:

### On Windows:
        
- After installing Node.js, make sure to select the option to "Automatically install the necessary tools..." during installation. This will add Node.js and npm to your PATH.
        
- If you skipped this during installation or are still having issues, you can manually add Node.js and npm to your PATH:
                 
- Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar and click on "Edit the system environment variables."
                 
- In the "System Properties" window, click the "Environment Variables" button.
            
- In the "System Variables" section, find the "Path" variable, select it, and click "Edit."
            
- Click "New" and add the path to your Node.js and npm installation. The default installation path is typically C:\Program Files\nodejs\.

- 1: Clone repository Open in VScode
- 2: Open terminal in VScode (control j)

This should then give you the link to the local host website. It is very generic at this point but the backbone is in and it is ready to be worked on.
