This is where you will place images, hopefully. These are some stuff to follow so we don't get in trouble and have a good looking website :)

- If possible get .png or transparent images (To give the website a good look)
- Be sure the images have "Public Domain", "All Creative Commons", or "Free to Share and Use Commercially" licenses. (I don't want to be arrested)
- Make sure that the images have good names before adding them into the Assets folder. (To make our code look good and readable)
- Make sure that the image is <25MB (It will count as a large object in GitHub, and will cost real moneys)

That's mostly it, and thanks!

Guide to starting the Local Website:
1: Clone repository Open in VScode
2: Open terminal in VScode
3: Run command: npm install 4. Run command: npm run dev
This should then give you the link to the local host website. It is very generic at this point but the backbone is in and it is ready to be worked on.
