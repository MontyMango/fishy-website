This is where you will place images, hopefully. These are some stuff to follow so we don't get in trouble and have a good looking website :)

- If possible get .png or transparent images (To give the website a good look)
- Be sure the images have "Public Domain", "All Creative Commons", or "Free to Share and Use Commercially" licenses. (I don't want to be arrested)
- Make sure that the images have good names before adding them into the Assets folder. (To make our code look good and readable)
- Make sure that the image is >25MB (It will count as a large object in GutHub)

That's mostly it, and thanks!
